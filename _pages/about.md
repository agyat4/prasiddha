# About Me

Currently, I work as a Network and Automation Engineer at Nepal Telecom, where my responsibility is network monitoring, optimization, and developing automation tools using Python. Before that, I worked in the same company as an Integrated Maintenance Incharge in remote parts of Nepal (Okhaldhunga, Solukhumbu, and Khotang districts). As a maintenance engineer, I had to mobilize teams, including myself, to maintain all possible domains (RF, Power, Transmission) to ensure the Telecom Network runs smoothly with minimal downtime and perform preventive maintenance as well.

## Academic Background

Academically, I completed my MSc in Information and Communication Engineering from IOE, Pulchwok Campus, Tribhuvan University, focused on Image Technology and Machine Learning. In my academic journey, I have conducted research on the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-resolution images of Devanagari handwritten characters (Nepalese Alphabets).

## Aim and Interests

My aim is to explore deeper into the field of AI and ML, focusing on areas such as explainable AI, responsible and trustworthy AI, AI safety and security, and combating the misuse of AI technology. I am passionate about exploring these domains and contributing to the advancement and ethical implementation of AI and ML algorithms.

### Interests

I am interested in the fascinating realms of AI and ML, particularly in their implications for safety, security, and ethical considerations. I am keen to explore the field of explainable AI, striving to understand the inner workings of AI models, making them more transparent and interpretable. I am enthusiastic about promoting responsible and trustworthy AI practices, ensuring that ethical principles guide the development and deployment of AI systems. Delving into the challenges of AI safety and security is another area I am eager to explore, working towards building robust and resilient AI systems in different domains such as computer vision, networking, or cybersecurity. Additionally, I am passionate about addressing AI misuse (e.g., deepfake detection) and utilizing AI for positive societal impact.
