## Academic Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Institute of Engineering, Tribhuwan University. During my undergraduate studies, I gained a deep understanding of digital systems and their components, along with the role of mathematics in engineering. I also got chance to explore the world of computers ( their Architecture, Graphics and  Networks). My final year project focused on computer vision and image processing, where my team and I built an integrated biometric access control system utilizing face and fingerprint recognition as identification methods. This project ignited my passion for image processing and computer vision, ultimately shaping my decision to specialize in these areas during my master's studies.

I completed my MSc in Information and Communication Engineering from IOE, Pulchwok Campus, Tribhuvan University, focused on Image Technology and Machine Learning. During my masters, I have conducted research on the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-resolution images of Devanagari handwritten characters (Nepalese Alphabets).


## Interests

I am interested in the fascinating realms of AI/ML and image processing, particularly in their implications for safety, security, and ethical considerations. I am  also keen to explore the field of explainable AI, striving to understand the inner workings of AI models, making them more transparent and interpretable. I thik it has been very necessary about promoting responsible and trustworthy AI practices, ensuring that ethical principles guide the development and deployment of AI systems. Challenges in AI safety and security is another area I am eager to explore, working towards building robust and resilient AI systems in different domains such as computer vision, networking, or cybersecurity and addressing AI misuse and misinformation.


## Current Profession

Currently, I work as a Network and Automation Engineer since last 4 years at Nepal Telecom, my responsibility here is network monitoring, optimization, and developing automation tools using Python. Before that, I worked in the same company as an Integrated Maintenance Incharge in remote parts of Nepal (Okhaldhunga, Solukhumbu, and Khotang districts). As a maintenance engineer, I had to mobilize teams, including myself, to maintain all possible domains (RF, Power, Transmission) to ensure the Telecom Network runs smoothly with minimal downtime and perform preventive maintenance as well.



## when I am free...

I like learning to play different musical instruments when I either feel exhausted or am free. I have learnt to play MADAL, Bamboo flute and a little bit of guitar till today. I also like to play video games that has some kind of stories to explore. My all time favourite Video game is MAFIA:The City of Lost Heaven.
