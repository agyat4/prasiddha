## Academic Background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in electronics and communication systems. My final year project focused on computer vision and image processing, where my team and I built an integrated biometric access control system utilizing face and fingerprint recognition as identification methods. This project ignited my passion for image processing and computer vision, ultimately shaping my decision to specialize in these areas during my master's studies.

I completed my MSc in Information and Communication Engineering from IOE, Pulchwok Campus, Tribhuvan University, focused on Image Technology and Machine Learning. In my academic journey, I have conducted research on the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-resolution images of Devanagari handwritten characters (Nepalese Alphabets).


## Interests

I am interested in the fascinating realms of AI and ML, particularly in their implications for safety, security, and ethical considerations. I am keen to explore the field of explainable AI, striving to understand the inner workings of AI models, making them more transparent and interpretable. I am enthusiastic about promoting responsible and trustworthy AI practices, ensuring that ethical principles guide the development and deployment of AI systems. Delving into the challenges of AI safety and security is another area I am eager to explore, working towards building robust and resilient AI systems in different domains such as computer vision, networking, or cybersecurity. Additionally, I am passionate about addressing AI misuse (e.g., deepfake detection) and utilizing AI for positive societal impact.


## Current Profession

Currently, I work as a Network and Automation Engineer since last 4 years at Nepal Telecom, my responsibility here is network monitoring, optimization, and developing automation tools using Python. Before that, I worked in the same company as an Integrated Maintenance Incharge in remote parts of Nepal (Okhaldhunga, Solukhumbu, and Khotang districts). As a maintenance engineer, I had to mobilize teams, including myself, to maintain all possible domains (RF, Power, Transmission) to ensure the Telecom Network runs smoothly with minimal downtime and perform preventive maintenance as well.
